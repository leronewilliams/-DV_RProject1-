The RCurl package was loaded to allow general HTTP requests and process the results returned by the Web server.\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/dataframes.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nA second R script dataframes1.R was created to display each data frame that was previously created in the last step. The head() function was used to only return the first parts of each data frame.\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/dataframes1.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nIn order to plot each data frame, the ggplot2 package was loaded and a different geom, short for geometric objects was chosen as follows:\ndf1 = geom_point(), \ndf2 = geom_path(), \ndf3 = geom_density2d(),\ndf4 = geom_dotplot()\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Visualizations/ggplot.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nFinally, using the df5 data frame created from the entire data set, the following three plots were produced.\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Visualizations/ggplot1.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
